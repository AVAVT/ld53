# AMA Jo

AMA Jo is a bot-programming game, in which you (the main character) must disguise as an AI by writing a bot to seamlessly automate the stocking & delivery of packages in an AMJ's warehouse.

The game will progress through 5 days, in each day the task your bot must handle become progressively more complex.

Mistakes in managing the drones will raise suspicion from the SYSTEM. And when the SYSTEM has identified you as a human, it'd be game over.

# Where to play

The game is currently available on Windows. Though it should be easy to build for other platforms.

Latest build is available at https://avavt.itch.io/ama-jo
